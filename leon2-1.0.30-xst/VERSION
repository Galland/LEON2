	* Added optional secondary interrupt controller
	* Fixed UART transmitter lost interrupt problem
	* Updated xilinx .ngo file for PMON

------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEON-1 VHDL model version 2.3.1, released on 13 May 2001. (J.Gaisler)

	* Updated virtex_prom256.ngo to contain latest PMON
	* Added utility to put rdbmon in boot-prom on FPGA's
	* The UART can now optionally be clocked from PIO[3]
	* Added possibility to use both internal and external boot prom

------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEON-1 VHDL model version 2.3, released on 27 April 2001. (J.Gaisler)

	* APB peripherals in mcore used wrong clock (thanks Steven!)
        * UART receiver used wrong irq enable bit (uart.vhd)
	  I fixed this once already but somehow it got lost ...?
	* ASI mapping: only ASI 8 - 11 are cachable
	* Added PCI arbiter (thanks to R.Weigand, ESA)
	* Added hardware multiplier and divider for V8 MAC/MUL/DIV
	  (MAC/MUL work funded by ST, thanks Cosma!)
	* Re-structured target dependent libraries, only tech_map.vhd
	  needs to be edited to add support for new foundry.
	* Synplify- and Leonardo-specific packages removed, not needed
	  with synplify-6.2 and leonardo-2001.1a !
	* PMON enables both uarts by default

------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEON-1 VHDL model version 2.2.2, released on 3 March 2001. (J.Gaisler)

	* Added complete synthesis script for synopsys DC (syn/leon.dcsh)

	* fix problems with 'X' in post-synthesis simulation by letting
	  the test program explicitely initialize the data cache 
	  and certain registers (tsource/*.c)

	* added pull-ups on data bus and I/O port in VHDL test bench
	  (tbench/tbgen.vhd)

	* work-around for synopsys bug in aggregates (tech_atc35.vhd)

	* documentation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEON-1 VHDL model version 2.2.1, released on 19 February 2001. (J.Gaisler)

Additions:
	* Added regfile and cache ram tests (tsource/ramtest.c)
	* iram: can use *.dat files produced by both LEONCCS and LECCS
Bug fixes:
	* dcache: LDDF followed by FPOP could corrupt data on cache miss
	* mctrl: write waitstates for ram/rom used read-ws setting
Beauty spots:
	* timers: wr signal missing in process sensitivity list
	* documentation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEON-1 VHDL model version 2.2c, released on 1 November 2000. (J.Gaisler)

Additions:

	  configuration table
	* Wacthdog can be supressed in configuration record
Bug fixes:
	* boot-prom (bprom.c) failed to set proper stack pointer
	* Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEON-1 VHDL model version 2.2b, released on 13 October 2000. (J.Gaisler)

Additions:
	* 16-bit memory interface + read-modify-write option
	* boot-prom with memory auto-configuration
Bug fixes:
	* Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEON-1 VHDL model version 2.2a, released on 6 October 2000. (J.Gaisler)

Additions:

	* AMBA AHB/APB buses
	* boot-prom
	* Synopsys VSS/FC2 support
	* Leonardo 1999.x support
	* Xilinx Virtex ram generators
Bug fixes:
	* wong dependency check in MULSCC when icchold enabled
        * UART receiver used wrong irq enable bit (uart.vhd)
	* DPRAM168x34 & DPRAM168x39 had only 136 regs (ramlib.vhd)
	* sregsin missing in decode process sensitivity list (iu.vhd)
	* Wrong data dependency check when FPU is enabled (iu.vhd)
	* STF instruction did not check for address alignment error (iu.vhd)
