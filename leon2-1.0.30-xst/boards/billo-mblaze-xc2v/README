Hints
============================================================
SW-0 ==> DSU enable
SW-1 ==> DSU break

- No reset switch is configured in this design (boards push-buttons are left unused for other applications). 
  If you want to reset the processor, do it through dsumon.
- Serial port connection should be ==> 0 X, to allow usage of both DSU and UART1 serials.
- You need a serial Y-Cable. If you don't have one, refer to the website below.
