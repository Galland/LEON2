Reset is on SW1.

To get UART1 and DSUMON running on the XSV800 a serial Y-adapter 
has to be built.

xsv800 | CPLD Pin | serial
-------+----------+-------
rd     | 80       | UART1-rx
td     | 81       | UART1-tx
cts    | 85       | DSUMON-rx
rts    | 82       | DSUMON-tx

To Enable DSUMON SW6-1 and SW6-2 must be turned off.
