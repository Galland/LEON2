LEON synthesis scripts
----------------------

The synthesis scripts are now placed in a sub-directory for
each synthesis tool. The following tools are supported:

synopsys :	scripts for Synopsys DC and FC2

synplify :	scripts and project files for Synplify

xst      :	scripts and project files for Xilinx ISE/XST

In addition, templates for synthesis and place&route for a few
fpga boards are available in the boards directory.

NOTE: all LEON files are read from the standard leon source
directory (../leon), MAKE SURE ../leon/device.vhd REFLECTS YOUR
TARGET SETTINGS!!!
